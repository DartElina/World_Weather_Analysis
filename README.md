# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
The aim of this assignment is to create an app that can retrieve city info based on input from users. Users input ideal temps of cities they want to visit and the app generates a map like this:
![world marker map](https://github.com/DartElina/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/6f6963d7ff93e436f8aa809986c8b6ab65f7d6c7/Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation_map.png)

This map shows cities all over the world that have current max temps between a range of 75 and 90 degrees F today, markers indicate hotels in the given cities.

The next aim was to rfine these maps to pull specific cities we'd like to travel to and create an itinerary. Here we have selected a start city and 3 cities we'd like to visit before returning to the start city. Here is a map with the hotels we've selected to stay at:

And here is a map with directions to drive between the hotels:

## Summary 

We used API keys to pull data for local weather, as well as for pulling info on hotels in nearest cities. We created csv files with the data pulled. 
From the csv files we can create dataframes that the code we wrote iterates through to create the results found. Maps are generated by gmaps extension in jupyter notebook.
